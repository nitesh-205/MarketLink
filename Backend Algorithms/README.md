## 🛠 Deployment
Each model is contained in its own `.ipynb` notebook and can be:
- Run on **Google Colab** (recommended for cloud compute and ease of access)
- Executed locally using **Jupyter Notebook**

## 🔍 AI Models Overview

### 🌱 1. Crop Recommendation System
**File:** `all A.I crop recommendation.ipynb`  
**Description:**  
Recommends the most suitable crops for cultivation based on soil parameters like Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, pH, humidity, and temperature.

> 📊 Dataset: `data crop_recomendation .csv`

### 🧪 2. Disease Detection for Crops  
**File:** `AI Disease crop dtection.ipynb`  
**Description:**  
Uses image classification (CNN or transfer learning) to detect common diseases in crops such as tomato leaf blight, powdery mildew, etc.

> 📷 Use of plant leaf images for model training and prediction.

### 📈 3. Price Prediction System  
**File:** `commodity_price_model.ipynb`  
**Description:**  
Predicts future market prices for commodities using historical arrival and pricing data. Supports multi-day forecasting for informed decision-making.

> 📂 Dataset: `data A.I price prediction.csv`

### 🔄 4. Smart Matching Algorithm  
**File:** `smartmatchiing algorithm.ipynb`  
**Description:**  
A recommendation engine that smartly matches vegetables and produce from farmers to consumer demands or local markets using custom filters and ML logic.

> 📂 Dataset: `dataset smartmatching vegetable dataset.csv`
